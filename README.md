# Classic Aadhar Application

So this aims to develop a classic aadhar card web application where user caninput their details such as name, email, address, aadhar card number and date of
birth and sent this data for approval from admin. Now admin has access to each user data and can edit it if required and thus provide unique UUID to each user.

So below is a general outline of how I approahced towards this task:
# 1. Frontend Development:
• Create a user interface where users can input their information (name, email,
physical address, phone number, date of birth).
• And than implement form validation to ensure that users provide all information.

# 2.Backend Development:
• Create a database schema to store user details.
• Create API in backend to handle user submissions and admin login.
• And than Implement authentication mechanisms for admins to log in and manage requests.

# 3.Admin Panel:
• Develop an admin dashboard where admins can view all requests submitted by users.
• Provide options for admins to approve requests and modify user data if necessary.
• Implement functionality to generate UUIDs and associate them with approved requests.

# 4. Email Notifications:
• Once approved, admin will send confirmation emails to user such that their requests
are approved, including the generated UUID.

Feel free to discuss about project and please provide suggestion that will help me in enhancing my project.
